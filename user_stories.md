For any user:

  As a dog lover, I want to see a list of the best dog themed pictures of the week I visit the homepage.

  As a new user, I want to visit a page that will show me a random dog themed picture.

  As a long-time user, I want to see the history of my activity in my profile.

  As a interested user, I want to easily know what the theme the week is.
  As a interested user, I want to submit a photo of my dog dressed up as the theme.

  As a user, I want a very user-friendly interface.

As an admin:

  I want to remove photos that do not match the criteria (theme, quality, etc.)

  I want to keep track of the upvote/downvote so it can not be cheated by a user.
